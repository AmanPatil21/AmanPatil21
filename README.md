I have completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the [College of Engineerinig Pune](https://www.coep.org.in/). My experience spans across various fields within computer science. Currently, I am primarily concentrating on full stack development. I have expertise in languages like  Java, C/C++, JavaScript, Angular and Python. I have also worked on projects involving web development, DSA, Computer Networks, Operating system and NLP.

In addition to my academic endeavors, I have a profound enthusiasm for the learning process. This encompasses exploring new technologies, engaging with diverse academic subjects, and developing skills in new games. I find great fulfillment in expanding my knowledge and continuously seek opportunities to challenge myself and master new concepts and skills. In my free time I love playing Football and working out at the GYM.

I excel in connecting with new individuals, exchanging ideas, and collaborating. Please feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aman-patil-866174197/) or by [Email](amanjrajput2105@gmail.com) - I'm always eager to build my network. I'm currently seeking full-time software engineering roles and would love to learn about opportunities that align with my experience. If you come across an opening that fits my profile, I would appreciate you passing it along via email. I'm passionate about developing my skills and am excited to join a team where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow.
